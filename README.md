# Hackerrank_30days_python
Here are the solutions for hackerrank 30 days challenge. I did all of them by own, also i know some of the problems above could bring a runtime error and so with big dataset. I used those methods just for my own educational purpose. So don't make a pull request based on that, but you can add alternative solutions as many as you like. I'll appreciate that.
